Jathon - For Clearer Java Grammar
=================================

Please note
-----------

The class built_in (the name will change to "builtin" in the next version)
is **not** a class that can be initialized. To follow the original name in Python,
and **avoid people to use it to create instance**, this class's name is "builtin",
but not "BuiltIn" or "Built_in".
